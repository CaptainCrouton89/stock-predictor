# stock-predictor
Using neural networks to make stock predictions.

## Plan
- Use sentiment analysis on reddit + twitter
- Historical technical indicators: RSI, Momentum, Volume, a few more that "actually" work sometimes maybe
- Perform extensive backtesting on variety of stocks (must be GH for this somewhere)
